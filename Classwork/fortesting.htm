    <p>Babson&reg; College is a private business school in <strong>Wellesley</strong>, <i>Massachusetts</i>, established in 1919. Its central focus is on entrepreneurship education, and it is often ranked the most prestigious entrepreneurship college in the United States.[3][4][5][6]
<br>
            It was founded by Roger W. Babson as an all-male business institute. Now co-ed, Babson College offers bachelor's degrees in business administration and undergraduate students have the opportunity to declare concentrations in more than twenty seven areas of study. Through Babson's F. W. Olin Graduate School of Business, the college also offers master's degrees in business administration, finance, accounting, entrepreneurial leadership and management. Often referred to as the "Entrepreneur's College", Babson is renowned for immersing its students in the entrepreneurial lifestyle and culture. Babson is also notable for its Foundations of Management and Entrepreneurship course, in which every enrolled first-year student starts, runs and dissolves a company. Babson currently offers undergraduates nearly sixty entrepreneurship-related courses. These courses are taught in tandem with various traditional liberal arts courses, which represent over 60% of the typical student's schedule. Every entrepreneurship course at Babson is taught by professors who have either started, sold, bought, or run successful businesses.[7] Babson is considered very selective and currently has an undergraduate acceptance rate of 24%.[8]</p>
