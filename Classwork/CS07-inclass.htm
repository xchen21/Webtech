                    Why is it so easy for them? Are they better parents? Do they just not worry about every little

                    detail? I've never known a gorilla to read and study carefully seventeen books on bringing up baby

                    gorillas. And they seem to

                    know just what to do. They never worry about spoiling their little gorilla babies. They never worry

                    about not having enough time with them. Now, don't get me wrong, I'd rather be human than a gorilla

                    any

                    day. Just imagine having to sit in a zoo. (Did you figure out yet that while gorillas were on my

                    mind, I could

                    only find a picture of an elephant?)

                    It's hard to tell what goes through a baby elephant's mind when its mom is

                    trying to put it to sleep. Do

                    you think baby elephants wake up in the middle of the night and cry? Do their moms and dads take

                    turns

                    getting up with them to rock them back to sleep? How do you rock an elephant, anyway? And what

                    about

                    gorillas?

                <td class="thirtyfive">Today in the paper there's a story about a new gorilla that was just born in

                    Franklin Park. Its mom is holding

                    on to it just like any proud human mom. And I have to wonder if they go through as much trauma as

                    that

                    human mom when it comes to sleep, and food, and diapers, and running into the street. </td>

            <p class=â€œscroll">Source: http://elephant.elehost.com An elephant family is ruled by a matriarch (older

                female), and generally consist of her female offspring and their young. In Africa, a basic family unit

                consists of six to twelve animals, but families of twelve to twenty elephants are quite common. An

                elephant family will split depending on the size of the family, the amount of available food, and how

                well they are getting along.

                When the matriarch dies, one of the oldest offspring takes her place. An elephant family is led by a

                matriarch, with the matriarch being the oldest and most experienced of the herd. The matriarchal

                society consists of her female offspring and their young. In some cases it may include one of the

                matriarch's sisters and her offspring as well. It is this close contact and relationship allows the

                rest of the elephant to acquire knowledge to be used when needed.</p>
