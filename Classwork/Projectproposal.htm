            <li>My website will be an introduction site to the city of Beijing. Basically it will be introducing the food, the tourist attraction and some information and story about Beijing's culture.</li>
            <li>The objective of the website is to let more people know about Beijing, for them To get to know more about the city and the things that are not usually known to the foreigner. I want to do this because I am from Beijing and I love the city. It is a way of showing my love for the city by introducing it, the real and good side of the city to other people.</li>
            <li>My target audience is people that are interested in traveling to Beijing or just simply people that like to travel around and people that would like to know different cultre. </li>
