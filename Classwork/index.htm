        <p>After I graduate from Babson I want to go back to China and start working. My dream job is to work as a consultant and that is what I have been doing this summer. During this summer I interned at BCG as part time assistant and got to know more about how it is like working at a consulting firm. I like consulting because it enables me to work in different industries that I can get to know a lot of industries. For example, this summer I worked in cases of health care, finance, real estate industries and working in each case let me know more about these industries; therefore it is quite interesting and exciting as a job</p>
        <p>I used to exercise a lot and do a lot of sports but not anymore. If I have to choose my favoriate sport I would say shopping. When I shop, I do a lot of working so I guess I can call it a sport.</p>
